# Data-Science-What-Predictors-Have-The-Greatest-Effect-On-Dog-Adoption-Rates-
Our goal was to study the main predictors of whether or not an animal would be adopted. 

This was a group project done by 2 people, me and Joshua Gates

The most important files are:
1) The final report (summarizes findings)
2) Model 1 (Linear Regression)
2) Model 2 (Random Forest with Boosting)

All the excell files are the results of data cleaning
The R files were used to create the models and most of the data cleaning (some was done in excell) (Note: some R files are not included or were modified after running code to create model/cleaned data)
